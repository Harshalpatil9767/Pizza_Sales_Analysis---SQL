🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL to uncover key business insights for a fictional pizza company. It covers a range of essential SQL concepts including joins, aggregations, window functions, and subqueries — all applied to solve real-world business problems.

📌 Project Overview
In this project, I used SQL to explore and answer 12 business questions related to pizza orders, revenue, customer preferences, and sales trends. The analysis provides a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making in areas such as marketing, inventory management, and customer behavior.

💡 Key Business Questions Solved
📦 Total number of orders placed

💰 Total revenue generated from pizza sales

🍕 Identification of the highest-priced pizza

📏 Most common pizza size ordered

🔝 Top 5 most ordered pizza types by quantity

📂 Total quantity ordered by pizza category

🕒 Order distribution by hour of the day

📊 Category-wise distribution of pizza types

📅 Average number of pizzas ordered per day

💸 Top 3 pizza types based on revenue

📈 Percentage revenue contribution by category

📉 Cumulative revenue trend over time

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
SQL (MySQL)

Joins (INNER JOIN)

Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, ROUND)

Grouping & Ordering

Window Functions (OVER)

Subqueries

Time-based analysis

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes 4 key tables:

orders: Order timestamps and IDs

order_details: Pizza quantity and order references

pizzas: Pizza pricing and size

pizza_types: Pizza category and name

🚀 Outcome
This project showcases how structured query language (SQL) can be used to extract meaningful insights from raw sales data. It simulates a real-world business scenario where data analysts support decision-makers through accurate and insightful analysis.

🔗 Future Work
Integrating the analysis with a dashboard (Tableau or Power BI)

Building a data pipeline for automated reporting

Applying predictive models for sales forecasting (using Python)
